CVSGrab is a simple CVS client that bypass any firewall blocking port 2401 used by cvs. 
It relies on the ViewCVS web interface to the repository to work, and supports other types of web interfaces (CvsWeb, SourceCast...) 
Use this tool when all other solutions (SSH...) fail. Only read-only access to the CVS repository is possible with this tool.

This release includes the following changes and improvements:
o Added support for CvsWeb 2.0 web interfaces
o Added the parameter -webInterface that forces CVSGrab to use a specific web interface, and disable the auto-detect feature that 
  doesn't work well with some sites.
o Small bugfixes, usability improvements

Enjoy,

Ludovic Claude
