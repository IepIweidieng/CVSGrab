CVSGrab is a simple CVS client that bypass any firewall blocking port 2401 used by cvs. 
It relies on the ViewCVS web interface to the repository to work, and supports other types of web interfaces (CvsWeb, SourceCast...) 
Use this tool when all other solutions (SSH...) fail. Only read-only access to the CVS repository is possible with this tool.

This release includes the following changes and improvements:
o Added support for Sourcecast 1.0 web interfaces (Netbeans.org)
o Small bugfixes, in particular to run CVSGrab on Linux

Enjoy,

Ludovic Claude
