PRESENTATION:

CVSGrab is another kind of CVS client. When other CVS clients use the cvs protocol
to read the repository, CVSGrab reads the repository via its ViewCVS web interface.
The advantage is that if you are behind a firewall that prevents you from updating files
from a remote CVS server, this program will be able to bypass the firewall and download
the latest files from the repository. Disadvantages are that you have read-only access
to the repository, and the repository needs to be public (password-protected sites are not 
yet supported, they will be if people ask for it...)

HOW IT WORKS:

It starts by reading the top page of the ViewCVS repository, then parses the links in this
page and browses all the pages bellow while downloading the files in them.
In addition, the CVS administration files (the files under the Cvs folder present on every directory)
are created and store the version number for each files. The next time you run CVSGrab, those version
numbers are used to download only the files that have being updated.

USAGE:

It can be used from the command line, or as an Ant task.

From the command line, use cvsgrab.bat or cvsgrab.sh to run it.
Type cvsgrab -help to get help
You may need to define the CVSGRAB_HOME environment property if you want to call cvsgrab.bat from any location.
It works like the ANT_HOME or JAVA_HOME property: put in CVSGRAB_HOME the location of your CVSGrab installation.

From Ant, add the following to the build file:
<property name="cvsgrab.dir" value="[Your CVSgrab installation directory]" />
<taskdef name="cvsgrab" classname="net.sourceforge.cvsgrab.CVSGrabTask" classpath="${cvsgrab.dir}/lib/cvs-grab.jar;${cvsgrab.dir}/lib/hotsax.jar;${cvsgrab.dir}/lib/jcvsii-light.jar"/>
Then you can use cvsgrab just as another Ant task:
      <cvsgrab destdir="${destDir}"
               rootUrl="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/"	       
               package="hotsax/HotSAX"
               cvsRoot=":pserser:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/hotsax"
               verbose="true" />
