Building Cvsgrab
----------------


* To build Cvsgrab, first you need to install Java J2SDK version 1.2 or better
Then install Maven 1.0 or better from http://maven.apache.org
Open the command line, CD to the the project root, then run

	maven dist
	
That's all, maven takes care of building cvsgrab from the source and it downloads all 
the necessary libraries from the network.
