When connecting to the first page of a CVS repository, it should be able to run some checks to determine 
which web interface is used (ViewCVS, cvsweb...) and which version. This information will be later used 
to determine which template to use when retrieving data from cvs.
It should be also possible to turn off this automatic feature by specifying exactly on the command line 
which cvs interface is used.

SuccessCriteria:

- automatic detection of the cvs web interface type and version by reading the first page
- allow the user to explicitely name the cvs web interface used. 

ExpectedTasks:

- add an optional parameter to the command line
- enumerate the most commonly used cvs web interfaces
- write a class that detects the type and version of the web interface used
